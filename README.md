# Peakboard Extension Samples
This repo contains samples for the Peakboard Extension Kit. The following list contains a quick explanation for each sample. The complexity of the samples rises from easy to difficult.
Here is a step-by-step guide how to run the samples:

1. Compile the solution (maybe update / restore the Peakboard Extensions Nuget package)
2. Put the binary output PLUS the extensions.xml file PLUS all referenced assemblies in a single zip file
3. Start you Peakboard designer and use the "Manage Extensions" button to add the extension to your local data source collection and enjoy it.

# Cat Facts
This sample is a supereasy sample and ideal for beginners to explore the basic concepts. It shows how to provide a simple, fixed list in Peakboard but already gives the user the option to adjust a list property.
